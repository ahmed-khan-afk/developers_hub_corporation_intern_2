## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Dart SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Android Studio **or** VS Code with the Flutter & Dart plugins

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-khan-afk/developers_hub_corporation_intern_2.git

# 2. Navigate into the project
cd developers_hub_corporation_intern_2

# 3. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 4. Run the app
flutter run
```

To run on a specific platform:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome       # Web
flutter run -d android      # Android
flutter run -d ios          # iOS
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) | ^2.2.2 | Persistent local storage for tasks |
| [`flutter_slidable`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable) | ^3.0.1 | Swipe actions (edit & delete) on task tiles |

---

## 💾 SharedPreferences Implementation

Tasks are JSON-serialized and stored as a `List<String>` under the key `tasks_list`. Every add, edit, toggle, or delete operation immediately re-saves the full list.

```dart
// Save all tasks
await prefs.setStringList(
  'tasks_list',
  tasks.map((task) => task.toJson()).toList(),
);

// Load all tasks
final List<String>? encoded = prefs.getStringList('tasks_list');
final tasks = encoded?.map((e) => Task.fromJson(e)).toList() ?? [];
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows a simple, clean architecture suitable for a week-long internship project:

- **Model** — `Task` class with `copyWith`, `toJson`, and `fromJson` methods
- **Service** — `TaskStorageService` abstracts all SharedPreferences logic
- **Screen** — `HomeScreen` manages state with `setState` and calls the service
- **Widgets** — Reusable, self-contained UI components with clear responsibilities

---

## 🎨 Design System

The UI is built around **glassmorphism** — a design trend using frosted glass-like surfaces:

- `BackdropFilter` with `ImageFilter.blur` for the frosted glass effect
- Semi-transparent tinted containers with subtle white borders
- Deep purple/indigo animated gradient background
- All glass containers use `Border.all()` with uniform colors for cross-platform compatibility

---

## 🌐 Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Android | ✅ Fully supported |
| iOS | ✅ Fully supported |
| Web | ✅ Supported (with `showDialog` instead of `showModalBottomSheet`) |
| Windows / macOS / Linux | ✅ Desktop scaffold included |

## 📚 Internship Context

This project was built for **Week 2** of the [DevelopersHub Corporation](https://developershub.com) Flutter Development Internship.

**Week 2 Task Requirements:**
- Build a To-Do List app in Flutter
- Display tasks in a `ListView`
- Add tasks using `TextFormField` with form validation
- Persist tasks using `SharedPreferences`
- Manage UI state using `setState`
